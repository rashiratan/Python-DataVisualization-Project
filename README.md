# Python-DataVisualization-Project
This is a repository for the Data Visualization project using matplotlib for my ISM4641 Python for Business Analytics 

In this assignment, I will apply the Matplotlib visualization techniques we covered in class to analyze business data for a fictional e-commerce company called “TechTrends.” TechTrends is interested in understanding their sales performance, customer behavior, and market position, and they need your help to create insightful visualizations that will guide their business decisions.

This assignment demonstrates my abilities to:
1. Create appropriate visualizations for different types of business data
2. Customize plots with proper titles, labels, and styling
3. Create multi-plot dashboards for comprehensive data analysis
4. Integrate pandas with matplotlib for efficient data visualization
5. Apply best practices for effective business visualizations
6. Draw insights from visualizations and communicate them effectively
